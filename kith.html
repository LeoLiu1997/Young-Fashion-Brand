        <p class="p">Established in 2011, Kith operates on two planes - a multifunctional lifestyle brand for men, women, and kids, as well as a progressive retail establishment. Our seven brick-and-mortar flagship stores were designed in partnership with Snarkitecture, as we push the boundaries to deliver customers a completely unique experience. We offer an array of premium products, ranging from our own in-house label to a curated selection of multi-brand apparel and footwear. In 2015, Kith Treats was conceived from a childhood love for cereal and dreams of one day opening up a cereal bar - now operating in eight locations, Treats has become a staple within Kith. Our brand has also extended to three shop-in-shops at Bergdorf Goodman, Hirshleifers, and at Selfridges. Embarking on our journey overseas we knew it was only right to bring a taste of New York with us; together with Major Food Group, we introduced our first restaurant - Sadelleâ€™s at Kith Paris.</p>
